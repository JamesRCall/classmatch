# ClassMatch

**ClassMatch** is a modern web application designed to help students discover compatible classmates based on shared courses, schedules, and study preferences. It enables users to create or join study groups, manage their weekly availability, and collaborate efficiently through an intuitive and responsive interface.

## Overview

This project was developed for **CS 4090 - Software Engineering** to demonstrate the process of translating user stories and use cases into a functional, user-centered web application.  
The app is built using **React (Vite)** for the frontend and styled with **Bootstrap (Bootswatch Darkly)** for a clean, modern dark theme. Local storage provides lightweight persistence for prototyping purposes.
